## The Story

I'm a software engineer who believes in challenging conventional thinking and building better solutions. Inspired by the "young turks" of Bell Laboratory, I document my journey through the ever-evolving world of technology.

When I'm not breaking production (kidding... mostly), you'll find me:
- 🔬 Experimenting with new technologies
- 📖 Reading technical books and papers
- 🛠️ Building side projects that may or may not see the light of day
- ✈️ Traveling and coding from different places

## Current Tech Stack

**Languages I speak fluently:**
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Kotlin

**Currently exploring:**
- System Design, Databases, AI Workflows

## Philosophy & Approach

```javascript
function myApproach() {
    while (true) {
        learnSomethingNew();
        documentTheJourney();
        shareKnowledge();
        if (stuck) {
            askQuestions();
            coffee.drink();
        }
    }
}
```
