# Why Do Not Give Up Learning?

> Inspired by Richard Hamming’s *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering* book

## 🎯 Introduction

In a world overflowing with knowledge, where technology evolves faster than we can track, the need to **keep learning** is no longer optional — it's essential.

But why do many people stop learning after school? Why do some lose their curiosity?  
And more importantly: **Why should you never give up learning?**

## 🧠 1. Learning Is a Style, Not a Phase

Richard Hamming, in his book, introduces *Reductionism* not just as a scientific method but as a **learning philosophy**.

It’s the art of breaking down complex genius into simple, repeatable parts. Instead of being intimidated by a master’s brilliance, you deconstruct it. You isolate the principles, techniques, and habits that underpin their success.

So the way is:

- Learning begins by **inheriting from a master**. The first step is imitation — studying the works, habits, and thought processes of those ahead of you.
- You study **successes**, not failures. There’s more to learn from understanding what works and why than what doesn’t.
- Over time, you evolve and **create your own style** of thinking. True learning is finding your own voice and approach.
- The goal is not just to consume knowledge, but to **re-create and personalize it**. You’re not a container; you’re a creator.

> “Create your own style. Inherit from the masters, but evolve.”

## 📚 2. Education vs Training

Are you preparing for a single race or a lifetime of marathons? This question lies at the heart of one of Hamming's most crucial distinctions for lifelong learners.

Hamming makes a clear distinction:

- **Education** teaches the *what*, *why*, and *when*. It builds conceptual frameworks that last and evolve with you.
- **Training** teaches the *how*. It is more mechanical and focused on current tools or methods.

In a rapidly changing world, training becomes obsolete.  
Education, on the other hand, builds the foundation for **lifelong adaptability**.

> “90% of all scientists that ever lived are alive today.”  
> The pace of knowledge is exploding. Are you ready to keep up?

## 🧱 3. Fundamentals Are Your Fuel

The knowledge you'll need 20 years (maybe even 5) from now **doesn't exist yet**.

What lasts? **Fundamentals.**  
Things like mathematics, logic, systems thinking — they outlive trends and serve as a lens through which all future knowledge is understood.

Focus on what's antifragile: concepts that gain value over time.  
Learn the principles that will empower you to understand anything new in the future, even when everything else changes.

## 🧭 4. Learn With Vision, Not Like a Drunk Sailor

Hamming compares two types of learners:

- The **drunk sailor** wanders aimlessly — learning speed ~ sqrt(n). They may cover a lot of ground, but rarely with coherence or long-term gain.
- The **visionary** learns with direction — speed ~ n. Even without knowing the destination, having a direction accelerates meaningful progress.

You don’t need to know exactly where you’re going,  
but you do need a **direction**. Without it, you're just drifting.

> “With the right direction, even wrong steps lead you somewhere meaningful.”

## 💡 5. Lifelong Learning: A Personal Manifesto

So why not give up?

- Because the world won’t wait. Change doesn’t slow down for anyone.
- Because future science hasn’t been written yet. You’ll need to be fluent in tomorrow’s knowledge.
- Because **you’re still becoming who you will be**. Your best version hasn’t arrived yet.
- Because your style, your voice, your genius — are built over time. Every day adds a layer to your identity.

Here's the manifesto I created based on Hamming’s thoughts and my own reflections:

## ✅ Closing Thoughts

Learning is not about completing a curriculum.  
It’s about **becoming the kind of person who grows**, adapts, and creates.

So today, ask yourself:

> **“What did I learn today — and who am I becoming because of it?”**

Never stop. Never settle. Keep learning.
